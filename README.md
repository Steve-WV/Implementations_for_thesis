# Implementations conducted for the Dissertation

In the above folders the readers of the dissertation of **Steve Wolff-Vorbeck** find tailor made implementations in **C++** and **Python** which were developed for different applications regarded in the thesis.

The development of the software packages in **C++** was done by **<a href = https://aam.uni-freiburg.de/mitarb/wolffvorbeck/index.html>Steve Wolff-Vorbeck<a/>** (**University of Freiburg**) on the basis of a finite element software created by **Prof. Patrick Dondl** (**University of Freiburg**).

The development of the software package in **Python** was was done by **Steve Wolff-Vorbeck** in collaboration with **Alexander Schulz** (**University of Freiburg**).

The different codes belong to numerical implementations which are provided as link in the respective sections of the thesis.

## Python–Implementations 

### Section 10: 

1. The **Python**–code in “**image_analysis**“ was developed for the image analysis performed in Section 10. 

The Code above uses the <b>Python-</b>implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) method from <a href ="https://github.com/ClayFlannigan/icp">here</a>

## C++–Implementations

### Section 4:

1. The **C++**–code in “**liquid_drop**“ was developed for the computation of shapes of minimizers for the liquid drop model with and without connectedness constraints.

### Section 7:

1. The **C++**–code in “**rigidity_optimization**“  was developed for the computation of minimizers in a multi-material bending-torsion problem. 

### Section 11:

1. The **C++**–code in “**density_geometry**“ was developed for the computation of the effective elastic modulus of a gyroid geometry. The resulting effective moduli are used for a fuzzy structural analysis in Section 11. 

### Section 12:

1. The **C++**–code in “**3d_cylinder**“ was developed for three-dimensional P1 finite element approximation. The approximation is used for evaluating an effective elastic energy for a 3d-model of a cylinder. 

2. The **C++**–code in “**1d_surrogate_model**“ was developed for one-dimensional P1 finite element approximation. The approximation is used for evaluating an effective elastic energy for a one-dimensional surrogate model regarding a cylinder geometry. 

The Codes developed for Section 12 use the open source software package on cubic spline interpolation in <b> C++ </b> from <a href ="https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/">here</a>
